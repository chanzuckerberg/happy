# Metrics

Simple memory and CPU usage metrics for staging and production are automatically collected by ECS. Additionally, we are in the process of building out dashboards from the Snowflake data. These dashboards arenâ€™t quite complete, but can be [found here](https://app.snowflake.com/us-west-2/czi_sec/sastisfaction-dOrtZZ7SX).
