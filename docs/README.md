# What is Happy Path?

Happy Path, affectionately known internally as "Happy", is an opinionated project lifecycle management tool which helps you
with the complexities of managing software deployments across multiple environments and AWS accounts. It is designed to
set you up early on the Happy Path to infrastructure success from the beginning of your project, rather than needing to
figure it out as an afterthought when it's least convenient.
