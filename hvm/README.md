# Happy enVironment Manager

The `H`appy en`V`ironment `M`anager (`hvm`) is similar to other tools, like `nvm` or `rvm`. It is meant to manage multiple installed versions of Happy and other software packages distributed by CZI via Github.

Each Happy project can create a `.happy/version.lock` JSON file, which specifies which versions of various packages the project requires. `hvm` can automatically install them and manage your path for you via `zsh` shell hooks or explicit CLI commands.

HVM is essentially a Github-based package manager, which installs CI/CD-produced assets directly from Github. It tries to be smart about architecture and operating system, and allows defaulting of specific versions for when a version is not otherwise specified (see `set-default` command).

# Compatibility Notes

## Operating Environments

This version of `hvm` was only tested on Mac and Linux. Behavior on Windows is currently unknown. It'll probably work under WSL2, but that has not been tested. Bug reports welcome, as always.

## GitHub Projects

`hvm` communicates directly with Github, and parses tags, release names, and asset filenames in order to operate. It does not have a central registry or metadata file to rely on otherwise. This means that anything it must install must be set up very consistently with the way the `chanzuckerberg/happy` repo names version tags, releases, and release assets.  It was primarily made to work with `chanzuckerberg/happy`, so that repo is the "reference implementation", for better or worse. 

If this becomes a problem, we can likely introduce some sort of metadata file that can be generated by CI/CD in Github Actions which points things in the right direction, but for now, things just have to be named "correctly." 

# Quotas

Note that Github imposes request rate limits. For normal usage by individuals, this is not likely an issue. However, if this is to be used in CI/CD or automations, then quotas may quickly be reached. For now, `hvm` does not support the use of PATs or other auth to Github, so the anonymous hourly rate limits by IP address apply. 

## Quick Start

Common to all shells:
```
mkdir -p $HOME/.czi/bin $HOME/.czi/hooks

# Download `hvm` to somewhere in your $PATH
curl ....... # todo. Host hvm somewhere.

```

Once you have done the above, follow the instructions specific to your shell below to complete setup.

If using `zsh`:
```
# Make sure $HOME/.czi/bin is in your $PATH
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.czi/bin:$PATH' >> $HOME/.zshrc

# Download the zsh shell hook from this repo's `hvm` directory and save it in $HOME/.czi/hooks/
curl .... # todo. Need URL.

echo '
source $HOME/.czi/hooks/hvm-hooks.zsh
' >> $HOME/.zshrc

# (OPTIONAL) Now restart your shell session OR execute the below in your current shell to load the hooks, if desired

source $HOME/.czi/hooks/hvm-hooks.zsh
```

## Usage

Most commands require 2-3 parameters:

* `org`: The GitHub org which owns the project (usually `chanzuckerberg`, but could be any other)
* `project`: The repo name inside of the `org` (e.g. `happy`). Project must conform to `hvm`'s established release/asset naming patterns.
* `version`: The version of the package, which is the version tag minus the `v`.

### help

Help is always available using the `help` command for `hvm` itself and each subcommand.


### download

The `download` subcommand simply downloads the tarball for the requested package to the current directory or a path specified by `-p` or `--path`. It is generally meant for use in shell scripts where the default `install` behavior does not fit the use case.

You can specify the `arch` and `os` if you'd like to download binaries that are not for your current architecture or os. The default is to match the current arch/os. 

Valid `arch` values: `amd64` and `arm64`

Valie `os` values: `linux`, `darwin`, `windows` (see COMPATIBILITY note above)


### env

The `env` command outputs shell commands intended to be `eval`ed by your current shell:

```
eval $(hvm env)
```

This currently only manages `$PATH`, but may manage other things in the future. 

It can be run explicitly as above, but is intended to be run via shell hooks each time your directory changes. This allows `hvm` to automatically manage your environment as specified by your Happy configurations.




### install

The `install` command is used to download a package and extract it under `.czi/versions/<org>/<project>/<version>`. This is to allow for multiple concurrently-installed versions. This does NOT set your default version. See `set-default` to choose a default version.




### list-releases

Get a list of available releases of a package.


### lock

Create/update the locked version of a package in the current happy project. If you are not in a happy project, this will return an error.



### set-default

Set a version of a package to be used when:

* Outside of a Happy project
* The current project does not contain a `version.lock` file
* The `version.lock` file does not specify a version for a given package

This works by creating a symbolic link under `$HOME/.czi/bin` to the binary installed under a specific version of the package. 

When inside a Happy project, `hvm` will prepend any specified versions to your `$PATH`, so they will supercede this default. If the project does not specify a version for a given package, or does not have a `.happy/versions.lock` file, there will be no match in your `$PATH`, and the path search will eventually fall back to `$HOME/.czi/bin`.




## Installing the zsh Shell Hook

See the Quick Start for commands. This describes the general process.

### zsh

* Download the `hvm-hooks.zsh` file from the `<happy git repo>/hvm` directory into `$HOME/.czi/hooks`
* Add the following command to your `.zshrc`:

```
source $($HOME/.czi/hooks/hvm-hooks.zsh)
```

| IMPORTANT: Make sure the `hvm` binary is in your `$PATH`!


## Environment Variables
